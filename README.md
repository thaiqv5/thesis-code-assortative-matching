# thesis-code-assortative-matching
R scripts and output files for Masterâ€™s thesis on assortative mating and income inequality.

This repository contains R scripts and outputs used in my Master's thesis titled:

**"Assortative Matching and Its Effect on Household Income Inequality"**

# Structure

- `merge_data.R`: Loads, merges, and harmonizes EU-SILC data for CZ, ES, SE.
- `analysis_script.R`: Couples formation, match-type classification, Gini & S80/S20 computation, counterfactual simulations, and regression analysis.
- `output/`: Charts and CSVs generated from the analysis (e.g., Gini trends, income distributions, model results).

# Notes

- Data are based on **EU-SILC microdata**, which are restricted and not included in this repo.
